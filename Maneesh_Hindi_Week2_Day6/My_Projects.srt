Hi Everyone , Welcome to G1ANT Tutorial

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,880
In this tutorial I am going to tell about some daily life project

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,840
which I can automate with the help of G1ANT Robot

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,460
My first project is On/ OFF the night light

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,600
and increase the brightness according to the user

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,180
first I write this Program

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,000
with the help of ui.click , I am clicking

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,540
at this Wpath

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,740
after that performing all these operations

10
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,960
after that asking for user if he give yes answer

11
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,600
then again I am clicking

12
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:40,520
again Night light is closing/off

13
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:48,480
after that if i want to increase brightness, then I am asking to user

14
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,880
if Yes then How many percentage

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,940
here I am incerasing

16
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,660
Now I am going to run

17
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,620
okk Yes

18
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:17,700
close okk yes

19
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,700
20%

20
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,046
Due to recording i am not able to show you

21
00:01:26,046 --> 00:01:31,820
how brightness will  be increased when recording closed It will work

22
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,800
Now my another project is moving file from one source to another destination

23
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:49,420
the location of my source is this and location of my destination is this

24
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:53,820
First I am counting this file from source

25
00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:00,120
after that I am going to my source directory

26
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:08,400
here I am again printing no of files with the help of for lop

27
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,580
I am coping one by one files and moving to a destination

28
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,480
so that in this way all the files which is available in source will reached to a destination

29
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,560
now I am going to run

30
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,780
5 files to be moved

31
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,320
okk

32
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,960
congratulation 1 file has been moved

33
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,760
okk

34
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,000
okk

35
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,780
okk

36
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,880

38
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:59,320
all the files has been reached in my destination

39
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,680
In this project I perform some operation

40
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,020
with the help of selenium addon first I am opening G1ant manual

41
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:17,880
and open crickbuzz and again opened crickbuzz

42
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:24,100
and opened amazon. and want to take information of some project

43
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:34,020
I want to buy a headphone so I daily watch it to see the increased and decreased price

44
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,480
and printing the price at notepad

45
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,720

and want to classify this image and want to extract some information

51
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,280
with the help of watson classifier

52
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:22,640
you have to make account on IBM cloud and have to make api key before writing this command

53
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,000
after that performing this operation

54
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:31,800
I am classifing my image and printing the information on notepad

55
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,120
Now I am going to run

56
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:50,980

00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,920
It will take some time'

72
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,760
because lots of message has to read

73
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,600

74
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,900
