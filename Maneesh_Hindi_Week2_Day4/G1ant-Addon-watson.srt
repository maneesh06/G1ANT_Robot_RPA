00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,900

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,020
after that inserting this url in this veriable

9
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:36,480
with the help of watson.classifyimage command, we can classify any image

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,520
here I am classifying this image

11
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:45,560
and here i am giving my api key

and here I am giving this url.

13
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:55,100
all extracted information is printed in the dialog box

14
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:01,000
Now i am going to tell you how Can I generete this api key

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,220
firstly open IBM Cloud website

16
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,700
first create his account and login in it

17
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,600
after that you can come on this page and

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,400
Go on the Catalog Service

19
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:30,040
As it is opened , there is available lots of command

20
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,520
As watson assistant , watson studio

21
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,840
Because I have to classify image , click on visual recognition 

22
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,340
So I am selecting it

23
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,640
and here

24
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,240
and click on create
and here

25
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,620
and click on create

26
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,620
as I already clicked

27
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,620
you have to click on this create

28
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:59,580
and you now reached on this page and click on service credential

29
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:06,620
click on New credential > add

30
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:10,760
now you reached on this type of interface

31
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,760
and now copy  it

32
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:19,380
now paste on notepad or otherwise copy this API key

33
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,380
this is your API key

34
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:27,340
so in this way you can generate your API key and paste here

35
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,340
now I am running it

36
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:38,640
you can see here all the extracted information is printed  in dialog box

37
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,920
now come on the another comand

38
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,100
now again I am generating api key

39
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:52,660
so to generate this api key go in the speech  to text key

40
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,200
as  I earlier told here

41
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,180
Go in catalog

42
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:08,140
and follow same process to go speech to text process

43
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,340
now again I am declaring serveruri variable

44
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,340
and storing this url

45
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:26,180
with the help of watson speechtotext we can transcript  any audio file

46
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,180
this is my audio file

47
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,680
here I am storing my api key

48
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,080
this is url and printing the result in a dialog box

49
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,080
now i am running

50
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:49,020
my audio file is very large 

51
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,020
 so it may take some time

52
00:03:51,020 --> 00:04:00,760
here you see information has been printed in a dialog box

53
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,760
thank you
