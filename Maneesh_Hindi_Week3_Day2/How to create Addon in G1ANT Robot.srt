How to create a addon in a G1ant robot

click on next

9
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,600
This is the name of my project and this is a location

10
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,040
Here is framework we also can change it

11
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,260
you can see default tempelate of G1ant has been opened

12
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:23,280
We have to reset it to resolve errors

13
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,580
Go in Project

14
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,800
> manage nuget Package

15
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:38,480
Here we have to reset it or uninstall it

16
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,060
click on uninstall

17
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,000
Go to browse

18
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,180
and search for G1ANT

19
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,220
install G1ant again

20
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,240
you can see

21
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,360
G1ant has been installed

22
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,260
now I am closing it

23
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:24,200
we can to defing class for adding the commands

24
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,720
For defining class

25
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:31,660
Go in Add > Class

26
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,300
here we can write the name of class

27
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,060
suppose

28
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,540
Myfirst command

29
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,480
you have to add .cs extension

30
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,020
Firstly

31
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,920
myfirst command has been opened

32
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:15,640
first we have to define the namespace of G1ANT language

33
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,420
.Language

34
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:37,120
in this class you have to define his command

35
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,200
which you want to perform

36
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,980
then I show you my entered command

37
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,320
you can see here

38
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,120
I write this command early

39
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,140
first you have to descriptive your command

40
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,320
name of my command is mynewcommand

41
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:50,740
in tooltip you have to give the description of command - here this is a demo command

42
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,500
here I define a class my_G1ant_command

43
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:01,760
as a command class

44
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,820
class may be variable and structure

45
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:16,100
here I am defining abstract scripter as a public class

46
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,980
we donot have to write any command with in this abstract scripter

47
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,920
here I am defining the argument of a command

48
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,280
we define argument as public  class

49
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,180
and define it in command argument class

50
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:43,120
Here I am descript the argument as I descripte the command

51
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,300
name of argument is user

52
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:55,040
If argument is required and I write true otherwise write false

53
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,660
in tool trip we give the description what is the use of this argument

54
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,600
type text to display

55
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:15,740
here I am defing argument as a textstructure

56
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:21,460
here we have to take it from user and have to set it

57
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,680
in a text structure command

58
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:31,560
Here I am defining a excute function here again

59
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:38,160
defining this excute as a void means it didnot return anything

60
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,680
and  defing as a pubic class

61
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:47,320
here I am taking the argument which I define earlier

62
00:06:48,840 --> 00:07:02,880
We have to the value of text in message box

63
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,060
I have written this command

64
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,940
go in the build

65
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,880
and click on build solution

66
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,360
solution has been build

67
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,340
Go in addon >

68
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,100
and click on open containing folder

69
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:45,960
and search for .dll

70
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,640
and copy it

71
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:58,380
and paste in add on under G1ANT robot

72
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,960
I pasted it

73
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,880
Now I am opening my G1ant robot

74
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,380
G1ANT Robot  has been opened here

75
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,720
go in addon

76
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,060
my addon has been added

77
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,500
I also give name addon it

78
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:37,760
I define my command

79
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:44,260
as a usre we can give any text

80
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,620
suppose Hello

81
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,240
Now I am running it

82
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,780
you can see

83
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,440
In this way we can create any addon in G1ANT robot

84
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,840
Thank you
