Hi everyone, Welcome to G1ant tutorial

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:09,020
In this I will tell you how to add python addon in G1ant robot

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:15,740
so for adding firstly go in tool menu > marketplace

4
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:22,740
and click on G1ant.Addon.Python

5
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,520
I have installed already that's why showing already installed

6
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,660
close

7
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:38,020
Go in view menu > Addon

8
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,680
you can see here python is already added

9
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,480
Now tick on python addon

10
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:55,160
Now I will tell you how I can run a python code in G1ant studio

11
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,600
first I am launching python with the help of program

12
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:09,700
with the help of keyboard this script is printed in the python

13
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,440
Now I am pressing enter

14
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:21,880
Now write same code in G1ant as I write in python

15
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,880
you should write understanding python as

16
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,820
first I am defining a string in a variable

17
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:39,040
we use semicolon for changing the line

18
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,700
in python if I want to print then I write S and press enter key

19
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,400
Now I am writing s and pressing Enter

20
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:55,420
then above written code run in the python interpreter

21
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,440
Now I am running

22
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:05,520
First with help of keyboard it is printed as written in G1ant

23
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,320
then script is running in python

24
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,400
as script  run in python

25
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,840
answer is printed

26
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,940
now see how to perform addition

27
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,240
nothing do you do as I told earlier

28
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:31,380
first launch python ,write same script which u want to run

29
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,860
when this is is printed in python interpreter than it is able to understand what I have to do

30
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,900
this is printed in python

31
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,820
it run after pressing enter

32
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:53,380
first here printed with keyboard

33
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,860
semicolon mean line change

34
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,100
as entered It run and give answered

35
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,980
here I defining list

36
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,880
simple defining  list  variable

37
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,640
again changing line

38
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,160
now using max function for finding maximum element

39
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,740
and printing maximum element

40
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,520
and pressing enter

41
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,640
first it is printed here

42
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,320
and now pressing enter and his answer is printed here

43
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,200
now see tuple

44
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,340
first simple defining tuple

45
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,320
then I am accessing second and last element

46
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,180
python has index 0 1 2

47
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,200
here 1 means Banana

48
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,900
-1 mean end

49
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,300
end means cherry

50
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,560
both printed after pressing enter

51
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:24,200
I am wrinting in G1ant studio then If want to hive space in string then I have to use triple prime sign

52
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,100
now run it

53
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,000
simple printed

54
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,140
both answer comes after pressing enter

55
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,240
So guys in this way you can run any python script in G1ant studio

56
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,260
Thank you for this video
